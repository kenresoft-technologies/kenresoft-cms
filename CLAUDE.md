# Kenresoft CMS Monorepo

## CRITICAL: Branch Rules

**NEVER commit directly to `main`.** Main is production — pushes will trigger CI/CD deploy
once a deploy pipeline exists.

- Work on `develop` branch (default working branch)
- Feature work goes on `feature/*` branches off develop
- Merge develop → main via PR (or the user's preferred flow) when ready to deploy
- If you find yourself on main, stop and `git checkout develop` before doing anything

## Project Overview

**Kenresoft CMS** is a reusable, Cloudflare-native, API-first content management platform.
First production implementation: the Pathvera Group website. It is not a Pathvera-specific
dashboard — additional projects/clients must be able to use the same CMS without a rewrite.

**Full architecture and technical specification: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**
— this is the source of truth for design decisions, domain model, API contract, security
rules, and the implementation roadmap. Read it before making architectural changes. Any
deviation from it should be recorded in its Changelog section.

**Monorepo layout** (pnpm workspaces):
- `apps/api/` — `@kenresoft/api` (Cloudflare Worker, Hono, D1, R2)
- `apps/admin/` — `@kenresoft/admin` (React + Vite admin SPA)
- `packages/database/` — `@kenresoft/database` (Drizzle schema, migrations, seed data)
- `packages/contracts/` — `@kenresoft/contracts` (shared Zod schemas / API contract)
- `packages/types/` — `@kenresoft/types` (shared TypeScript types)
- `packages/config/` — `@kenresoft/config` (shared ESLint/TS/Prettier config)

## Tech Stack (locked — see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §25 for full table)

- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers + Hono + D1 (Drizzle ORM) + R2
- **Admin**: React + Vite + React Router + TanStack Query + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Tiptap
- **Auth**: better-auth (D1/Drizzle adapter)
- **Validation/API contract**: Zod + `@hono/zod-openapi`
- **Testing**: Vitest + `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` + Playwright (E2E)

---

## Package Manager

**Always use `pnpm`** — never npm or yarn.

---

## Git Conventions

- Do **not** add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or similar AI attribution) trailer to commit
  messages.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits.
- Every schema change goes through a Drizzle migration — never edit the D1 schema without
  one (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §16).

---

## Dev Servers

- API: `apps/api` — `wrangler dev`
- Admin: `apps/admin` — `pnpm dev` (Vite)

Ask before running long-lived dev servers if the user has them running elsewhere already.

## Status

Per the roadmap in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §20:

- **Phase 1** (Worker + Hono + D1 + Drizzle + migrations) — done.
- **Phase 2** (Projects + content types + fields + entries domain model) — done.
- **Phase 3** (admin auth + dashboard + dynamic editor) — in progress. better-auth backend,
  login flow, and authenticated admin CRUD routes for projects/content-types/entries are
  done, along with Projects/Content Types/Field Definitions screens in `apps/admin`. Still
  open: the entries list and the actual dynamic entry editor (a form rendered from a content
  type's field definitions).

CI is green on `develop`.
